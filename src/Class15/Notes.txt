Types of variable with respect to their scope:
There are three type of variable with respect to their scope
1 local variable
2 instance variable
3. static variable
a variable tha is created inside a method loop switch case or any block of code is called local variable
    When we should use local variable:
    local variable occupy computer memory for short amount of time, but they are limit in scope we cant use local variable
    outside of the block of code// anything inside the block of code is  local variable// up-side is they exist for a very
    short amount of time in the memory
    // Down-side  they are limit in scope we cant use local variable outside the block of code
    we should always try to use
for( int i=0; i<5; i++){
System.out.println(i);
}
 2- Which are declared outside a block of code but inside a class are called instance variable
 they occupy the memory for long
 up-side: we can use these variables inside any block of code that is inside that class
 downSide: occupy the memory for long
  1)when we should use instance variable , when we need to share a value betwen two or more methods then we should go with
 instance variable
 2) when we  planning to create multiple object of class and it is possible that all object can have a different value
 for that variable
 3 if an instance variable has a key word static is called static variable
 up-side: When we need to share something across the object
  but it occupies the memomory for longer time
  when use: when we want to share something across all the method
