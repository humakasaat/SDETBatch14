     Methods in java:
     Methods in java is simply a block of code or some java statement put together in a block of code

    Methods is a block of code .or java statement grouped together.
    Methods help us reduce the amount of code that we have to write. for example i f a piece of cod is being repeated
     we can create a method and call that method
     Syntax of creating method
    in java we can not create a method only class
    [data type] [ method name][ ( datatype variableName)][ method name]
    data type can be void boolean String in etc
    [data type variableName)]
    how we decide that we should use void or method, a method with return keyword1
    if we are building a method that will be used by others or in other part of you code which requires some data from
    your method like an if condition we should not create methods with void
    return keyword we are using when we define a data
    when it says print we use void like
    Create a method that will take 2 parameters as a numbers and prints which number is larger./
    void printLarger( int num1,int num2)
    if (num1> num2){


    }
